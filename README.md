# Fire Department logging system
## Technology used
1. RFID cards and readers
2. Raspberry Pi 3 
3. Simple web interface
## Why would fire department need that?
After every single intervention or activity in firehouse someone is required to write everything down and I want to automate that.
Instead of using pen and paper, participants would only need to swipe their cards and leader would add any additional data. 
### 1. Logging interventions
Logging would work in 3 steps:
1. Swiping the card in first 10 minutes:
    - You were one of the first guys on scene.
2. Swiping the card 10-30 minutes after the alarm:
    - You were in the firehouse but didn't come to the scene(reserve firefighter) or arrived late.
3. Swiping the card after 30 minutes:
    - You just checked in, helped with cleaning, prepared any additional things for guys on scene.
### 2. Group activity
1. Working Saturdays:
    - Every Saturday other group is on duty. They get a list of everything they need to do. They need to provide list
    of participants and how many hours they spend in the firehouse.
2. Fire guards:
    - Many events are held through the year in our town, so we often provide fire guard and first aid kit.
3. Seminars, analysis etc. : 
    - Our fire department often organizes various seminars and analysis after interventions
4. Various other events
